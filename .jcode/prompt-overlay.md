# Local Patch Maintenance Rules (kmou424 fork)

This working copy is the kmou424 fork of jcode. When doing self-dev work here,
follow the fork's patch management rules:

## Repository layout

- Fork remote (read-write): `git@github.com:kmou424/jcode.git` (`origin`).
- Upstream (read-only): `https://github.com/1jehuang/jcode.git` (`upstream`).
  Fetch tags from it.
- Patch branch naming: `kmou424/<upstream-tag>` (e.g. `kmou424/v0.84.0`).
  Each branch is based on a specific upstream tag — never on a moving
  `master`.

## Commit conventions

- **Docs commit first.** The first commit on every `kmou424/<tag>` branch is
  the fork-documentation commit with the fixed subject
  `docs(fork): kmou424 patch series`. It carries `.jcode/prompt-overlay.md`
  (this file), `docs/CUSTOM_HANDBOOK.md`, everything under `docs/custom/`,
  and all files under `.github/workflows/`. All later changes to docs,
  overlay, or workflow files are amended into that same first commit; the
  rest of the branch is then rebased on top and the branch force-pushed.
  Never scatter these changes across multiple commits. The fixed subject is
  how CI and agents locate the commit
  (`git log --fixed-strings --grep='docs(fork): kmou424 patch series'`).
- **Feature patches carry an ID prefix.** Every patch commit message starts
  with `[<ID>]` where `<ID>` is a two-digit number matching the feature's
  doc file (`docs/custom/<ID>-<slug>.md`). This is the only intentional
  deviation from conventional-commit style. Example:
  `[01] feat(providers): ...` pairs with `docs/custom/01-*.md`.
- **Format before commit.** Run `cargo fmt --all` (or `cargo fmt` on the
  touched files) before every commit — patch commits and the docs commit
  alike. Committed code must already satisfy rustfmt so later fmt passes
  produce zero diff; otherwise formatting drift ends up scattered across
  unrelated patches or left dirty in the working tree.
- **One-line commit messages.** Commit messages are a single subject line —
  no body. Anything worth explaining belongs in `docs/custom/<NN>-*.md`.
- **Renumber on drop.** Dropping a patch leaves a hole in the
  series; renumber every later patch forward before the next
  force-push: commit subjects, `docs/custom/<ID>-<slug>.md`
  filenames, and `[NN]` refs inside docs. Each patch commit
  carries its own renumbered refs via a rebase `edit` stop.
- **No `[NN]` ids in code comments.** Feature ids belong to
  commit subjects and `docs/custom/` docs only; referencing
  them from code couples code to patch ordering. Write the
  comment so it stands on its own.
- Each patch commit is a self-contained feature/fix; they get cherry-picked
  and reordered, so avoid mega-commits mixing unrelated changes.
- **Never silently carry upstream bug fixes.** If a bug exists in upstream
  code (verify provenance with `git log -S` / a detached-tag worktree), do
  not fold a fix into the series on your own. When the bug noticeably hurts
  the experience or blocks progress, ask the user whether to fix it. Only a
  bug that genuinely blocks the feature being landed may be fixed, and then
  it is squashed into that feature's own `[NN]` patch — never a standalone
  "fix upstream" commit. When a standalone upstream fix is authorized, mark
  its subject with the `[upstream-fix]` prefix
  (e.g. `[upstream-fix] fix(cli): ...`) so a later version bump can
  `git log --fixed-strings --grep='[upstream-fix]'` and re-evaluate whether
  upstream has already fixed it. A fix folded into an `[NN]` patch is instead
  recorded as upstream-fix candidacy in that feature's doc. Note
  upstream-fix candidacy in the doc either way.
- **Get approval before assigning work to a patch.** Before starting a new
  patch or folding the current request into an existing one, ask the user:
  name the patch number (`[NN]`) and describe the scope of changes, and only
  proceed after approval.
- When a change is a candidate for upstream (general feature/fix, not local
  config), note it in the doc and in the commit body so it can be PR'd and
  eventually dropped from the local series.

## Upgrade workflow

1. `git fetch upstream --tags`
2. Create the new patch branch: `git checkout -b kmou424/<new-tag> <new-tag>`
3. Cherry-pick the previous branch's commits in order — docs commit first,
   then numbered patches.
4. `git rebase -i` to group related patches: commits serving the same
   feature/requirement should be adjacent (and squashed when they are one
   logical change).
5. For every patch, check whether upstream now covers the feature or
   conflicts with its design. If upstream already implemented it, drop the
   patch and its doc. If the design diverged, flag it to the user and
   negotiate before rewriting.
6. Amend the docs commit if any doc or these rules changed, rebase, then
   force-push `kmou424/<new-tag>` to `origin`.

## Documentation layout

- `docs/custom/` holds one numbered doc per patch/feature:
  `<ID>-<slug>.md`, e.g. `01-named-provider-display-name.md`. The doc is the
  requirement-side reference for the patch: what it does, why, config
  surface, affected files, upstream status. Keep the set small — one doc
  per logical feature, not per commit or per file.
- `docs/CUSTOM_HANDBOOK.md` is the agent-facing handbook bundled into
  `jcode_docs`. Whenever a patch adds or changes a config key, tool
  surface, or user-visible behavior, update the handbook in the same
  change so agents can self-configure by searching it.

## Housekeeping

- **Force-push needs approval.** Before any `git push --force` /
  `--force-with-lease` (rebase cleanup, docs-commit amends, branch updates),
  stop and ask the user. Never push silently.

- **GC build caches after finishing a task.** Once the work for a request is
  done (commits pushed, daemon deployed if needed), prune dead Rust build
  caches so `target/` does not grow unbounded across sessions. Use the
  fork's precise GC (see `docs/custom/05-incremental-cache-gc.md`): it asks
  `cargo build --message-format=json` for the live unit set and deletes
  dead `incremental/` work-product dirs, dead `.fingerprint/` variants, and
  dead `deps/` artifacts — dormant-but-valid caches are kept. Run it right
  after a build so the oracle build is a no-op:

  ```bash
  # after selfdev builds — union the -p plan and the workspace plan so both
  # variant families stay live (feature unification differs between them)
  scripts/gc_incremental.py --profile selfdev --apply \
      --plan "--profile selfdev -p jcode --bin jcode" \
      --plan "--profile selfdev"
  scripts/gc_incremental.py --profile debug --apply     # after cargo test/build
  ```

  Dry-run first when unsure (omit `--apply`). A false positive only costs
  one crate's recompile, never correctness.
